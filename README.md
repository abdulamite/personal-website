# Welcome to my site!

This website is a simple react application to showcase some of my work. Feel free to poke around and see what is going on under the hood. I currently work as a Frontend developer at QLess Inc. where I create unique user interfaces, and write lots of javascript. Normally a README file talks about how to install a project and all that fun stuff, though this readme will mostly be a quick overview of my background for those that do not want to go through the website. ✌🏾
