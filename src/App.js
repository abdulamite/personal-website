          <p>
            Welcome to my website. This site is meant to showcase some of my
            work and help you learn a little bit more about me. I am Frontend

            . I currently work as a Frontend developer at QLess Inc. where I
            create unique user interfaces for our applications, write lots of
            JavaScript, and work to improve developer culture. Many of the
            projects that I work on a daily basis are for my company, so my
            projects are a bit sparse, though I do love playing new tools and
            technologies when I have a chance.
