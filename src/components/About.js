        Welcome to my website. This site is meant to showcase some of my work
        and help you learn a little bit more about me. I am Frontend Developer

        . I currently work as a Frontend developer at QLess Inc. where I create
        unique user interfaces for our applications, write lots of JavaScript,
        and work to improve developer culture. Many of the projects that I work
        on a daily basis are for my company, so my projects are a bit sparse,
        though I do love playing new tools and technologies when I have a
        chance.
